In the afternoon of 11 December 2020, the Master led the crew members including the Chief Engineer, Fourth Engineer and three able seafarers deck to repair the leakage of the hydraulic oil pipe underneath the cross deck beside the aft bulkhead of the No. 2 cargo hold.  For the purpose of accessing the hydraulic oil pipe, the crew members decided to use the hold cleaning platform (the platform) lifted by the No. 2 ship crane to carry out the repair work.  When the platform was lifted to the height of the hydraulic oil pipe, the Chief Engineer stretched his body out of the railing of the platform intending to secure the platform to the aft bulkhead.  The platform tipped over suddenly, resulting in an able seafarer deck (SM1) who was at the other end of the platform lost his balance and fell over the railing of the platform.  Although the SM1 wore the safety harness with a lanyard, he failed to fasten his lanyard to a strong point.  Eventually, the SM1 fell from a height of about 10 metres with his right side body slammed onto the tank top of the No. 2 cargo hold.  Later that day, the SM1 was declared dead on board by the shore paramedics.

At the time, the vessel was sailing on a westerly heading, approximately 10 nautical miles north of the Rottumerplaat. The vessel was beam trawling at the time. The starboard fishing net jolted suddenly, at which point the crew decided to shut off power to the propellor and to pay out the nets. During attempts to retrieve both nets, the trawl wire of the starboard fishing gear shot over the afterdeck, and the starboard outrigger boom swung suddenly upwards. Eventually, the crew were forced to cut through the starboard trawl wire. When the port gear was subsequently hauled in, the trawler capsized. After the skipper had been helped out of the wheelhouse, the three-man crew climbed onto the keel. One of the crew members was able to notify the home front via a mobile telephone. When the trawler sank, the crew members were able to swim to, activate and climb into the life rafts. Shortly afterwards they were rescued by the fishing boat TH-10 Dirkje.

Simultaneously, the engine and water ingress alarms was activated, while one of the seaman reported that there was water on the deck, at the stern of the vessel. The captain made the same observation by looking the aft deck after having stopped the engine. The heel and trim aft increased rapidly, making any investigation perilous. As the situation seemed out of control, the captain ordered the evacuation of the ship. In an emergency, he failed to give the alert using DSC via VHF. Without wearing life jackets or personal protective equipment against drowning, the captain and the two seamen jumped into the sea. The ROMAIN LUCA capsized within seconds. The seamen quickly gave signs of panic, although the captain tried to help them hold on to the ship's hull. But in few minutes, they disappear from the captain sight. Around midnight the ROMAIN LUCA sank. The captain manages to grab a ring buoy, then the distress beacon, of which he sees the flashing light. About 1 hour and 30 minutes after the beacon was triggered, the Agde SNSM launch was in the area; the captain of ROMAIN LUCA is recovered 15 minutes later in hypothermia and shocked. The bodies of the two seamen will be found by divers from the French Navy on December 3, 2020, near the wreckage of the ship. Following the accidental hooking of the wreck by a trawler, the ROMAIN LUCA was refloated on January 19, 2022. After spending about two hours in water at 16 C, the captain was save by the good functioning of the emergency radio beacon. This was triggered automatically when the ship sank. The investigations carried out in December 2020 and May 2021, near the wreck of the ROMAIN LUCA, did not allow us to retain a sufficiently robust hypothesis on the initial cause of the sinking of the stern and the loss of control of the situation. which resulted. The inspection of the refloated vessel, carried out on January 19, 2022, however, allows us to favor one hypothesis : the disconnection of a water evacuation hose on the deck as being the cause of the sinking of the stern of the ship. The flooding was not limited to the steering gear compartment. When the water reached the level of the stuffing box of the exhaust passage on the watertight bulkhead, it was able to pass into the engine compartment.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life,Serious injuries,Ship rendered unfit to proceed","","","","","","0","","2","0","0","1","0","0","2022-08-03",""

The ship is a chemical and products tanker sailing under the flag of Malta. The master, the second officer at the helm and the advising port pilot were on the bridge. The Khlbrand was passed first and then the ship swung into the River Elbe. When the NORTHSEA RATIONAL was close to the desired course, the pilot informed the ship's command that it was now possible to switch to autopilot. At this point, the ship was sailing at a speed of 10 kts. The northern bank was not far away on the river. During the switching operation, the rudder suddenly moved to starboard quickly and unintentionally, reaching a rudder angle of 26.7 in the process. It then returned to the midships position after a brief period. The rudder deflection caused the ship to start turning to starboard. The bridge team's efforts to regain control of the helm failed and the NORTHSEA RATIONAL continued to turn toward the bank. The ship's command responded by setting the controllable pitch propeller (CPP) to full astern and issuing an order to let go the port anchor, thus reducing the speed of the allision with a quay wall on the northern side of the river. The allision caused heavy damage to the NORTHSEA RATIONAL's forecastle, which made it necessary to call at a shipyard. The quay wall also suffered heavy damage. Nobody was injured and there was no damage to the environment due to the event. The investigation report deals extensively with the technical investigations into the cause of the accident. It addresses the incorrect configuration of the steering gear control system, the resulting heavy load on electronic components and the sudden failure of a relay. Three expert reports were prepared in the course of these investigations, the findings of which also form part of this report. The safety recommendation made in this report refers to the improvement of the steering gear control manufacturer's manual.","Chemical Tanker","","3991","[Other]","6232","Other liquid","14","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2021-12-30",""

After a toolbox talk on the cargo hold (C/H) cleaning work on the morning of 21 November 2020, six crew members, including AB1 led by the Bosun, commenced the cleaning work.  The Bosun as assisted by an ordinary seaman removed a bolted cover of an opening on the cross deck at the aft of the No. 2 C/H to allow a fire hose passing through it for C/H water washing.  After removing the cover, the Bosun left and the ordinary seaman went down to the No. 2 C/H for water washing using a fire hose inside.  When AB1 was alone washing the aft end hatch coaming of the No. 2 C/H on the cross deck by using fire hose, he stepped into the opening accidently and fell to the bottom of No. 2 C/H.  Although an emergency rescue team was organized immediately and first aid treatment was applied to AB1, he was declared dead on board at about 1000 hours

The coronavirus pandemic had made it challenging for the management company Wallem to secure the relevant personnel at the right time. The vessel also had to deal with a coronavirus outbreak among the crew on board and did not have a functioning chief officer in the port of discharge, Dalian. The vessel had been granted dispensation from the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) to sail with a reduced crew. In connection with the unloading operation, the captain assumed the duties of the chief officer, and the 3rd officer was assigned the duties of the 2nd officer. A cargo surveyor from shore should have measured the tanks after unloading, but this was not possible due to coronavirus restrictions. After departure Dalian, the captain received notice, in the form of a ROB claim, that the vessel had too much cargo remaining on board (ROB) after the unloading. The NSIA is of the opinion that the captain was concerned about this and wanted to check the ROB status in the tank despite plans being in place to inspect this later. The captain died when he, alone, entered a cargo tank that had not been cleared for entry. The tank contained inert gas and the atmosphere was unsafe. The cause of death was a coronary infarct. It cannot be concluded with certainty that the coronary infarct was due to carbon monoxide poisoning. The bosun attempted to use the Stop-Work-Authority (SWA) card in accordance with the companys procedures before the captain entered the tank, but it did not work as a barrier to prevent him from doing so. The shipping company had established tank entry procedures, which clearly set out that entering tanks with an unsafe atmosphere was not permitted. It is unclear why the captain nonetheless decided to enter the tank. The NSIA is of the opinion that the many challenges facing the captain and crew on board during the period created an extraordinary situation that affected the decisions that were made and thus contributed to the accident arising. Following the accident, the shipping company has implemented several measures to prevent similar accidents. The NSIA will therefore not submit any safety recommendations following this accident.","Oil Tanker","Loss of life","55898","","105400","","","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2023-01-19",""

When the vessel was fully loaded with logs and a fumigation process remained in transit on board, the Bosun was assigned to top up fumigant in the cargo holds on the fifth day after the initial fumigant application into the cargo holds in transit at sea.  The top-up work was carried out smoothly from the ship forward No. 1 cargo hold.  When the Bosun came to the forward access hatch of the No. 5 cargo hold, he noticed that the fumigant gas concentration indicator (dositube) was detached from the internal side of the access hatch cover.  He then entered through the access hatch attempting to retrieve the detached dositube inside.  The Third Officer (3/O), preparing for the top-up work close to the Bosun, suddenly heard a loud sound from the access hatch.  He noticed that the Bosun slipped on the inclined ladder below the vertical ladder under the access hatch.  The Bosun was rescued and taken out of the access hatch, his pulse was very weak and his heartbeat could not be detected.  A few hours later, the Bosun was declared dead by the paramedics on their arrival on board

After the exhaust side of the exhaust gas boiler (EGB) was cleaned, it was subject to a running test before putting back into service.  During the running test, steam was found leaking from the water outlet valve of the EGB.  The EGB was depressurized to allow the Third Engineer (3/E) and the Fitter to work on the leaking valve.  They opened up the valve and reconditioned the parts.  To assemble the valve, the 3/E used a rope to lower down the bonnet cover of the valve from above with the assistance of the Fitter who held another rope lashed to the bonnet stem from below to ensure alignment with the valve casing while lowering.  Upon completion of lowering the bonnet to the valve casing, hot water suddenly gushed out of the bonnet joint of the reconditioned valve and scalded the Fitter underneath.  The Fitter was sent to a local hospital for medical treatment but he died about one month later. The investigation revealed that the crew members failed to follow the “Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seafarers”,  (the Code) to dissipate or isolate the thermal energy in the EGB together with the attached pipe resulting in hot water gushing out to scald the Fitter.
The investigation also identified that the crew members failed to strictly follow the risk assessment report to carry out the required control measures of the repair work; and that the crew members did not have sufficient safety awareness to apply good craftsmanship to control the potential fatal hazards when handling repair work.

Due to the restricted visibility, both ships navigation relied on instrumentation only. Neither of the ships identified the other ship until a few minutes before the collision, and neither ship managed to avoid the collision once the risk of collision was recognised. In the investigation report, DMAIB clarifies the circumstances for the late recognition of the risk of collision and the failed attempt to avoid the collision. The investigation primarily describes the events from the perspective of ICE ROSE, as DMAIB does not have jurisdiction to investigate warships and thus had limited access to data from to 311 KAZANETS. DMAIB concludes that the collision happened as a result of the navigational practises on both ships on that day. On ICE ROSE several coinciding factors contributed to the bridge team not recognising the risk of collision until 311 KAZANETS was at close quarters. Those factors included bridge layout, radar settings and the division of work within the bridge team.","Refrigerated Cargo Ship","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","12401","","136.66","","22","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2021-05-05",""

After half an hour of crossing, at approximately 3:12 p.m., a fire broke out in the engine room located on the port side, the ship was about 4 miles north of the port of Ceuta. The crew decided to stop the engine affected by the fire and try to put out the fire with fire extinguishers. Given the impossibility of suffocating it, the other engine located on the same hull was stopped and the CO2 system was triggered. This action managed to suffocate the fire. Once the fire was extinguished, the journey continued to Ceuta, where the ship docked with the help of a tugboat. CONCLUSIONS: After analysing the existing evidence, the CIAIM has not been able to clarify the technical causes of the start of the fire, but from the collected evidences, the following can be concluded: 1) The CIAIM cannot determine the immediate cause of the fire, although it considers that: - There was an accumulation of fuel in the aft-starboard area of the PIME engine on the port hull, where the fire was focused. Despite the previous point, it is not ruled out that the accumulation of fuel was in a different way than the one indicated by the Company. - The accumulation of fuel was enough to produce a fire capable of melting the walkway of the engine room, remembering that the melting point of aluminum is 660 C. - The accumulation of fuel occurred prior to the start of the fire; otherwise, there would have been a localised fire in the fuel injection pump that supposedly lost the screw. - The change of the fuel filters cannot be related to the total loosening of the screw and the subsequent start of the fire. - The accumulation of fuel cannot be confirmed when it started, whether with the detection of the pressure drop or before. 2) There was a lack of supervision of the machinery on board, as indicated by the following facts: - The fuel leak wasn't detected during engine inspection when going down to change fuel filters. - The sealing wires of the spill plug of the fuel injection pumps were not installed, as required by the engine's Operation and Maintenance Manual. The crew confirmed that it was not verified that such wires were placed when receiving the bombs. - The tightening torque of the spill plug was not supervised. 3) From the above points it can be deduced that the maintenance and supervision system on board the VOLCAN DE TENO is, to say the least, improvable. It can be stated that the crew managed to control the fire in a few minutes (approximately 2 minutes) using the resources available to the ship. It also successfully launched the passage meeting plan.","Passenger / Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","6363","Bureau Veritas (BV)","710","","21","39","41","0","0","0","0","0","0","2023-02-17",""

was extended horizontally across the beam of a working container ship MV „MSC Ajaccio‟. This
vessel was moored near the end of the adjacent wharf at the stern of the vessel MV „MSC MIA‟.
On 13 September 2020, the vessel „MSC MIA‟ was moored on the starboard side alongside a berth,
(Muelle Transversal Costa) at the inner basin of the Port of Valencia, Spain. There was another
vessel “MSC Ajaccio” moored starboard side alongside the adjacent berth, a short distance away
behind the „MSC MIA”. The vessel „MSC Ajaccio‟ was working on container cargo operations with a
container crane boom extended some 20 meters protruding beyond the beam of the vessel. She was
taking bunkers from a barge „Leon‟ alongside at the same time.
On the morning of 13 September 2020, the vessel „MSC MIA‟ was ready to sail after cargo
operations. At 09:08 hours (LT), a pilot, boarded the vessel to unberthed her from the container
wharf. There were 2 tugs in attendance. One tug with a line fastened to the stern of the vessel and the
other with a line fastened forward of the vessel. The pilot‟s intention was to maneuver the vessel to
the outer basin stern first to turn her round instead of at the inner basin. According to the Pilot, it was
easier for him. To the Master, it was an unusual maneuver, however, he did express concern about the
movement but did not stop the Pilot from doing so.
At 09:20 hours (LT), the vessel started to cast off from the wharf by the tugs and cleared from the
wharf. Once cleared of the vessel „MSC AJACCIO‟ which was moored at the stern of the vessel, the
„MSC MIA‟ then started to go with slow engine astern. She started to pass too close to the quay
container crane boom which was extended horizontally across the beam lifting containers on and off
the vessel „MSC AJACCIO‟. The horizontal boom, according to the Master, was extended some 20
meters beyond the beam of the vessel „MSC AJACCIO‟ and protruding to the sea. This could pose a
hazard to a vessel berthing and unberthing at an adjacent wharf.
At 09:35 hours, as the vessel was drifting astern, the engine casing (the funnel) of „MSC MIA‟ hit the
boom of the container crane. The accident caused the container crane to collapse and damage some
containers and some containers fell overboard. The vessel‟s engine casing was damaged as well as
some structures on deck (Please see photos below). However, there were no injuries to personnel on
board, the crane operator/driver was unhurt.
At the time of the accident, the Master, 2/O, and an A B, were on the Bridge and so was the Pilot who
was indicating the commands of unberthing the vessel.
Immediately after the incident, the pilot assessed the situation and decided to continue to maneuver

1.2 	The vessel departed from her home port located in Geoje, Republic of Korea at around 07:00 on September 8, 2020 for cable laying opearation, and set to work after arriving at the working site of approx. 28 miles south-southwest off Jwasari Island in Tongyeong City, Gyeongsangnam-do at around 13:00 on the same day.
1.3 	While the cable laying installation was ongoing at around 01:30 on September 11, 2020, Second Engineer A, transferred the oil stored in the F.O drain tank to the settling tank, and operated the valve for changing fuel oil tank for use on the same day at around 02:00. 
1.4 	Meanwhile, on the same day at around 02:35, Second Engineer B acknowledged the F.O leakage alarm on the monitor in the Engine Control Room (hereinafter referred to as “ECR”) indicating that oil was leaking from the first and second cylinders of the Main Engine.
1.5 	When Second Engineer B went to the site and checked the condition of the Main Engine, he observed that a large amount of oil was leaking from the surroundings of the jacketed high pressure fuel pipes of the first and second cylinders of the Main Engine.
1.6 	Second Engineer B went back to the ECR to check the temperature of the exhaust gases of the Main Engine, but no significant deviations were observed, and he called Chief Engineer and First Engineer who were taking a rest in the accommodation to report the situation.
1.7 	Upon receiving a call from Second Engineer B, Chief and First Engineers came to the Engine Room and smelled strong oil mist. After checking the site, they observed a situation where the flywheel of the No.1 Main Engine rotating at high speed came into contact with the oil at the top of the bilge well right below the flywheel, was creating oil mist.
1.8 	Chief and First Engineers considered that there was a problem in the No.1 Main Engine, and stopped it. But after figuring out that oil was also leaking from the No.2 Main Engine, they decided to restart the No.1 Main Engine and stop the No.2 Main Engine.
1.9 	Around 03:35, the Chief Engineer pressed the Air Cricuit Breaker (ACB) button on the monitor in the ECR to restart No.1 Main Engine and stop No.2 Main Engine. A few seconds later, a fire alarm activated and both No.1 and No.2 Engines were stopped as the ship blacked-out.
1.10	Engineers in the ECR opened the ECR door to check for a fire and to find the oil leak spot, but they had no choice but to escape to upper deck due to the thick smoke in Engine Room.
1.11	Second Engineer A and Third engineer went up to the Bridge and shut down quick closing valve of fuel oil tanks. Then, they went out of the Bridge and headed up to the funnel to close the Engine Room ventilation dampers but failed to close the dampers due to heavy smoke.
1.12	Meanwhile, Master reported the outbreak of onboard fire to the TongYeong Coastal VTS via VHF Radio around 03:40.  
1.13	After Master received a report from First Engineer at around 03:42 on the same day that local fire fighting had been failed, he instructed Chief Officer to use the onboard fixed CO2 fire extinguishing systems. 
1.14 	Master decided to abandon the vessel at around 03:50 on the same day as fire fighting with the onboard fixed CO2 fire extinguishing systems was not successful, and commended all crews to embark the Youngin 105 which was a work support vessel around the site. All crews boarded on Youngin 105, and then they were transferred to the Mirae-ro which was another cable layer operated by the Sehdong Shipping Co., Ltd. at around 05:00, and arrived at the berth No. 7 of Busan port at around 21:32 on the same day.
1.15 	While fire was being suppressed by the fire-fighting and the rescue teams dispatched from Tongyeong Fire Station and etc., the vessel sank into the sea about 42 miles south off Yokji Island, Tongyoeong City, Gyeongsangnam-do at around 17:42 on September 12, 2020, one day after the fire outbreak.","Cable Layer","Total loss of the ship","6298","Korean Register (KR)","8071","","60","","","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","[Primary Annex 2 not designated]","2022-05-18","2023-03-15"

When the helmsman tried to return the rudder to midships from a rudder angle of about 15 starboard, nothing happened at first. Despite the hand wheel being in the correct position, the rudder remained at 15. After a few seconds, a clearly audible alarm sounded and the steering control system switched to override. At the same time, the rudder angle changed to hard starboard (45) and then remained there, while still failing to respond to rudder orders at the hand wheel. The ship's turning speed accelerated even more rapidly. Despite an immediately initiated full-astern manoeuvre and emergency operation of the steering gear directly in the steering gear room, the RUBINA's prow ran aground within minutes. Luckily, this happened in a relatively 'harmless' position on the river. The rudder responded again just a brief moment later. After the salvage operations on the following day, the RUBINA was towed to a waiting pier in Brake. The ship was able to continue her voyage two days later. The cause of the non-responsive rudder was found to be a pilot valve of steering gear pump no. 2, which had stuck in an open position for a while.

To answer the Charterer, the Master through the Chief Officer (C/O) instructed the Bosun to check the extent of coal stain in cargo holds.  Afterwards, the Bosun was then last seen on the deck near the accommodation.  Anyhow, the Master did not receive any reply from the Bosun and the Bosun was not seen during the dinner on that day.
At around 0940 hours on 19 August 2020, the Bosun was found missing when the C/O called the Bosun for some routines.  After no response was received through the public address announcement, deck crew members were mustered to search for the Bosun.  Eventually, at around 1040 hours, the C/O and the Third Officer (3/O) found that the hatch of No.7 cargo hold forward access (the forward access) was opened, and they saw the Bosun lying on the first landing platform about 2.5 metres under the hatch.

During the tour, a couple of high speed turns were made, making one of two sets of seats loosen from the flooring, falling towards the other. Both fell overboard with all the passengers. The crew immediately started to rescue them as they also called Sweden Rescue. A near-by pilot boat came for an early assistance. A number of the eleven inflatable life jackets did not inflate. In the investigation it is concluded that the fall overboard was caused by the seats not being fastened well enough after some previous repair work. Some life jackets did not inflate due to lacking of a function to prevent the gas cylinder to unscrew. Underlying cause has been the lack of competent survey, allowing the deficiencies being unnoticed. The vessel was subject of new regulation for internal survey, which in this matter has had no safety effect.","Other Activities Ships","Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","","","","","2","0","","0","0","0","0","11","0","2021-03-01",""

In the afternoon, 17 crew members were transported from there to various passenger ships lay at the deepwater roadstead in the German Bight. 37 crew members from the anchored passenger ships were then taken on board. They were to be transported to Bremerhaven. The transfer from the roadstead to Bremerhaven began at 2110. The SEEWIND I entered the Weser fairway a little later. Since the waves now approached from abaft, the catamaran was able to sail at a speed of about 26 kts. Another wave system that had not been expected by the ships command then emerged briefly at 2158. The ships bow initially dropped further than before in these waves. The catamaran then plunged into the crest of the next wave at undiminished speed, bringing her to a near standstill almost immediately. The chief engineer officer was in the passenger area at this point so as to attend to the passengers. He lost his balance and suffered a serious injury when he fell. A female passenger suffered a minor injury. Both were then attended to by medically trained passengers. The SEEWIND I suffered minor damage as a result of plunging into the wave. The ship continued her voyage to Bremerhaven at reduced speed and the casualties were transferred to the rescue services there. The ship set sail for the port of departure after the classification society had surveyed her on the following day. In the course of the investigation, the Federal Bureau of Maritime Casualty Investigation (BSU) found that the SEEWIND I sailed into the wave system of an oncoming large container ship. The shipowners manuals available to date have not addressed this risk adequately. The investigation also revealed shortcomings in the manning of the ship and in the documentation.

During the current week, the two crewmembers had conducted night-time trawling in Skagerak and Kattegatt. One crewmember kept watch alone on the bridge, while the other was resting in his cabin below. When the vessel approached land, the crewmember on watch on the bridge dozed off. Shortly after 00.57 oclock, the vessel ran aground west of Hn about 35 meters from land. The fishing vessel was standing hard on the ground without the possibility to come afloat by use of its own power. The JRCC (Joint Rescue Co-Ordination Centre), Swedish Transport Agency and the Swedish Coastguard were informed almost six hours after the grounding had occurred, when the crew had started having problems draining the water that was leaking into the cargo hold. During the morning other fishing vessels and vessels from the Swedish Coastguard and Swedish Sea Rescue Society arrived at the site. KARLS was pulled afloat approximately eleven hours after the grounding by an assisting fishing vessel and could proceed under its own power to quay. The cause of the accident was deficiencies in the monitoring of the navigation induced by a built-up and critical sleep deficit for the crewman on watch. A contributing factor was that the work in itself and the limited crew complement resulted in the fact that the crewman on watch kept the watch alone during the night transit. Contributing to this was that a decision was taken to depart and transit to the home port after a long working day with limited possibilities to rest, instead of remaining in Skagen for a few hours to rest before the transit home. An underlying cause to the crewman on watch being alone during the night transit was that the crew complement onboard mainly had been organised according to the physical work regarding the fishing and not to the safety prerequisites for watchkeeping and rest. A deficiency at a systemic level is that the work and rest hours are unregulated for self-employed fishermen. The fishing industry's economic and competitive limitations do to a certain point counteract additions to the crew for this type of fishing operation.","Fish Catching Vessel","","182","","22.03","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2021-05-25",""

To perform an investigation of what may have caused the missing C/O officer, on June 10th,

casualty investigator. The investigator attends on M/V Cape Keystone at the berth No.5 at Port of
Zhangjiagang, China, while the vessel was discharged iron ore cargo between June 16th to 18th,
2020. During the investigation, the attending investigator interviewed most of the crew, and also
talked and discussed with the Master of the ship, 3rd Officer and Chief Engineer privately. He
collected all useful materials that could be found on board the ship to complete the investigation.

The ship was about to embark on her east-bound Kiel Canal passage. As is customary, the Kiel Canal pilot asked for a demonstration of the controllable pitch propeller system's functionality immediately after coming on board on the evening of May 17. The test was uneventful and they began entering the lock. When it came to the first attempted reduction in speed there was no change in propeller pitch, so that the speed could not be brought down. The Chief Engineer immediately rushed to the engine room and carried out an on-site reset of the system, which was successful, so that the desired speed reduction could be carried out quickly. Directly in front of the lock the situation recurred: When the vessel was to be stopped completely, the pitch propeller system did not react and froze on a low positive pitch. There was no time for another reset. Several attempts were made to reduce the speed using different manoeuvres. These efforts resulted in a speed reduction but not in a complete stop, so that the RIMINI collided head-on with the inner lock gate at 9:54 pm. An immediate inspection showed that nobody was injured. The lock gate was severely dented and its hydraulics damaged; the RIMINIs stem plating was deformed above the water line. Following the accident a number of repairs and service works were carried out, leading to the reassignment of Class with conditions, and enabling the RIMINI to continue her journey three days later. A loose contact that, in the opinion of the BSU, the ship's command could not have foreseen, and was extremely unfavorable in its very first occurrence, is thought to be the cause of the problem. The damaged lock gate was recovered within weeks of the accident. Repairs are expected to continue until the end of 2020.","General Cargo Ship","Ship remains fit to proceed","1862","Bureau Veritas (BV)","2600","","5","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2022-01-24",""

On the morning of 17 March 2020, in preparation for disembarking the Pilot, the Chief Officer (C/O) tasked the Bosun with adjusting the height of the pilot ladder. Due to DELICATA‘s freeboard at the time, a combination arrangement of the accommodation and pilot ladders had already been prepared. The Bosun assigned an Ordinary Seafarer (OS) to assist him with this task.  

The two crewmembers attempted to pull up the pilot ladder but were unable to do so as it was tied to an attachment point on the ship’s hull. The Bosun then descended the accommodation ladder, without wearing a lifejacket and safety harness, to untie the pilot ladder. Shortly thereafter, the OS heard the Bosun shout and looked over the side to see that he had fallen into the water. The OS immediately notified the crew over VHF and then went aft to the Accommodation to call the Bridge.

DELICATA and other nearby ships conducted a search for the Bosun. He was spotted by another outbound ship and was recovered by the pilot boat. When recovered, it was determined that he was deceased.

Initial information provided by MRO XI stated that MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO”, owned and operated by Gothong Southern Shipping Lines, Inc. (GSSLI), was moored and in the process of unloading her container cargoes when O/S xxx accidentally slipped from the Hatch Cover/Pontoon No. 2 and fell down at the port side passage main deck

Immediately, the onboard medical team provided first aid assistance to the severely injured crew member. Subsequently, the Master informed the Officer-In-Charge, Davao Terminal Operation Division of GSSLI, which in turn requested the assistance of Davao 911

On or about 17:32 Hrs, the ambulance arrived at the scene and brought O/S xxx to the Metro Davao Medical and Research Center, Inc. (MDMRCI) accompanied by the 2nd Officer. All efforts were undertaken to revive and administer emergency medical assistance to the concerned crew

At around 18:22 Hrs of 02 March 2020, O/S xxx was declared dead on arrival by Dr. Grace Stephanie Luna, attending Physician/Resident on Duty of MDMRCI

Based on the Clinical Summary Report of O/S xxx, the following was determined:

1) Left upper extremity has multiple closed fractures;
2) Right lower extremity has multiple closed fractures;
3) Right groin area has multiple femoral laceration, opening up to the subcutaneous area; and
4) Left Inguinal area has laceration exposing the internal iliac

The official cause of death was shock secondary to severe hemorrhagic shock.3 Initially it was reported that the concerned crew member accidentally slipped and fell down at the port side passage main deck while assisting on the removal of the pontoon hatch covers at Bay No. 23, 21, 19 and 25. However, circumstances suggest that the right leg of O/S xxx had been snag between the pile of pontoon hatch
covers and the gantry crane post. Thereafter, O/S xxx was seen by the Able Bodied Seaman assign at the quay area sitting at the hatch coaming before falling down at the port side passage main deck;

By way of background, MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO” departed Cebu Port last 00:15 Hrs of 29 February 2020 with 296 TEUs4 of container cargoes and was manned by a crew complement of 24 members. On or about 18:00 Hrs  of 01 March 2020, MV “DON CEFERINO ALFREDO” arrived at the outer berth of KTC Container Compound and started to offload her top deck container cargoes at around 09:42 Hrs of 02 March 2020

Upon the completion of the investigation, it was divulged that O/S xxx was standing at the port side hatch coaming and was walking towards the gantry crane. According to the gantry crane operator, prior to the occurrence, O/S xxx signaled him that he was intending to hitch a ride on the gantry crane moving towards the forward section of the vessel wherein the closed pontoon hatch covers at Bay No. 15, 13 and 11 were located

When the gantry crane had advanced forward, the right leg of O/S xxx got caught at the gantry post, severely injuring him. It was further deduced that O/S xxx was already severely injured when he fell from the port side hatch coaming. This is substantiated by the medical findings reflected in the Medical Summary Report of MDMRCI

During the ocular inspection, it was observed that there was only a distance of 0.2794 meter between the gantry crane post and stockpile of pontoon hatch covers. Slipping through the passage between the gantry crane post and the said pile was very difficult for the O/S. It was further observed that there is a blind spot on the area where the gantry crane operator is located when a crew member is situated at the port side of the vessel. Consequently, the distance between the hatch coaming and main deck passage way was only nine (9) feet or 2.7432 meters, which could not possibly facilitate a fatal fall to the seafarer unless a head injury/trauma was incurred from the accident. Based on the medicals findings, no head injury or internal head trauma was incurred by O/S xxx.

Approximately at the same time, the arrival of the m/v Kijac, an oil/chemical tanker, intended for the transportation of petroleum products along the coast, was expected. Weather forecasts warned about strong N and NE wind gusts in those days, especially for 5 and 6 February. It was decided and approved that Rinella M had priority of entry, and that Kijac had to go to the anchorage. In the morning hours of 4 February 2020, m/v Rinella M berthed at the terminal port side alongside, with 9 lines forward and 11 aft, and the port anchor was lowered with one shackle of cable in the water. Upon completion of the cargo discharge (6 Februrary 2020), at the initiative of the terminal, the flexible cargo handling hose and ground connection were disconnected, and shortly after that the protective floating oil-containment boom as well. The departure was arranged for the morning hours, by daylight. At 02:52 LT (UTC + 1), due to strong gusts of wind the bow began to move away from the terminal. The forward part of the vessel broke away from the berth and with her 4 headlines pulled the mooring buoy behind her. The master, who had the con, managed to make a semicircular starboard turn in the direction of the exit from the bay. The crew heaved up the anchor out of the water and released the remaining stern lines. Eventually, the vessel sailed towards the exit.

During the course of this and the following day, two Liebherr LHM 550 mobile harbour cranes were loaded onto the ship's hatch covers, one after the other. The ship's own cargo-handling gear was used in tandem operation to achieve this. By about 2045 on 31 January, the stabilising pontoons had been hauled in. The aft crane's wheelsets were swivelled in a transverse direction. For various reasons, this crane had to be moved a short distance towards the seaward side. At first it was accidentally started up in the wrong direction, before the mistake was noticed and it was moved in the required direction. After the crane had been moved by a few centimetres, it had to be stopped because of an obstacle. Despite the use of various operating commands it was not possible to bring it to a standstill. Without any apparent response, the crane rolled off the hatch and subsequently fell into the harbour basin. Due to the heavy list that this caused, the forward crane also slid into the water. The JUMBO VISION sustained minor damage, mainly to the fittings and railing of the water-side deck passageway. The two LHM 550s were salvaged about a month later. Up until then, the harbour basin concerned was closed, fully at first and later partially. There was minor water pollution due to escaping operating fluids. The BSU investigators were presented with various possible hypotheses as to why the crane had apparently not responded to the operating commands. These hypotheses were worked through one after the other and largely disproved. Ultimately, a combination of several factors proved responsible for the accident. The report closes with safety recommendations directed at the parties involved in the accident as well as the German Federal Ministry for Digital Affairs and Transport.","Other Dry Cargo (livestock, barge, heavy cargo, etc.) Carrier","Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","7966","Lloyd's Register (LR)","6993","","15","0","","0","0","0","0","0","2","2022-10-21",""

The crew had just set up the trawl and started to fish when sensors on the bridge indicated a large shoal of fish in front of the net. To prevent the destruction of the fishing gear, the net was immediately heaved from the bridge. The aim was to catch a manageable portion of the shoal. At the same time, the crew was called back to the deck by means of an audible signal. Since the six fishermen working on the deck assumed they would be performing a different task because the period between launching of the fishing gear and the signal being sounded was unusually short, they did not put on inflatable work vests. A south-westerly wind of 4 Bft prevailed at that time. During the works related to hauling in the fishing gear, one of the fishermen climbed halfway on to the bulwark so as to lean out and reach for an auxiliary line from there in a kneeling position. He lost his balance and fell into the water in the process. The other fishermen quickly lost sight of him. One of the fishermen threw out two lifebuoys equipped with a signal light. The bridge was informed of the incident immediately after the fall. The necessary measures, including manning the lookout positions and launching the workboat, were set in motion from there. The developing search operation was supported by seven other fishing vessels. A helicopter from HM Coastguard was additionally deployed later on. The search was unsuccessful to begin with. Since the inflatable work vest had not been donned, its personal locator beacon (PLB) was not available to support the search operation. It was only possible to recover the casualty three hours later. An emergency doctor who flew to the ship confirmed the death. The HELEN MARY returned to IJmuiden in the Netherlands and this is where the BSU began its investigation of the accident. The investigation uncovered evidence to suggest there is a need for improvements in communication between the bridge and working deck, as well as in responsibilities on the working deck. A recommendation on ratification of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F), which has already entered into force under international law, has also been formulated.","Fish Catching Vessel","Loss of life","7278","","6521","","50","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2021-02-08",""
