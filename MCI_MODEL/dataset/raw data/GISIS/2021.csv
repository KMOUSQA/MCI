The crew had started retrieving the telescopic accommodation ladder when a crew member’s lower leg got trapped between the fixed upper ladder and the moving lower ladder, resulting in serious injury to their leg.
As crew members were retrieving the accommodation ladder, it slipped off the Port platform on which it was resting. The slack side chains allowed the ladder to drop and the weight of the ladder was transferred to the fall wire, which caused the lower ladder to slide upwards. A crew member, who was standing in an area that had previously been identified and designated as a danger area, was seriously injured.
Actions to retrieve the accommodation ladder were not consistent with the procedures documented in the vessel's Safety Management System. Several control measures listed in the risk assessment for deploying and retrieving the accommodation ladder were not implemented. 
It is very likely that the accident could have been prevented, if other crew members standing in the vicinity had intervened and alerted the winch operator to a crew member standing in the designated danger area.

Two people were on board, the master and a deckhand. They had been on their way from Utklippan back to Karlskrona. Automatic steering was used to keep the course. Some time into the trip, the master became very tired and felt that he needed to rest. He then left the conning of the ship to the deckhand, who, however, remained in the passenger seat. The deckhand lacked nautical competence, but had been on trips to Utklippan before. Just before Bredbden, the deckhand noticed that they were about to run aground. There was no time to make any corrective measures and the ship hit the ground at a speed of about 15 knots. The sea rescue operation was hampered by the fact that the area around the ship was shallow and no other ships could go near SEAWORKER. Both crew members were rescued by being lifted into a sea rescue helicopter, less than an hour after the grounding. The crew of SEAWORKER escaped with bruises and abrasions. The damage to the SEAWORKER, however, was extensive and the ship was later scrapped. At the time, there was a weak southwesterly wind and meter-high swells. The visibility was very good. The grounding was caused by a lack of attention to lookout and navigation. Due to fatigue, the master left the operation of the ship to the deckhand, who had no formal nautical training. He also did not have proper conditions to be able to perform the task as he remained in the passenger seat in the wheelhouse. An underlying reason may be that the master was ill the previous week and probably misjudged his general condition, this in turn may have influenced the decision to let the deckhand handle the ship from the passenger seat.","Other Activities Ships","","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2022-08-18",""

After a short while the smoke development increased, the loading was stopped and the port staff called 112. Resources from the Landskrona Fire Service arrived at the scene shortly after the alarm and The Coast Guard assisted in the extinguishing work. The development of smoke was extensive which resulted in an evacuation of a shipyard in the wind direction. Also, a so-called Important Announcement to the Public signal was sent out. It took almost twelve hours to extinguish the fire. The fire caused minor damage to the vessel. The metal waste was mixed with different types of combustible material such as foam plastic, car tires and wood. Small amounts of flammable liquid were also found in the waste. The probable cause of fire was sparks or frictional heat generated during loading that ignited flammable liquid or other flammable material. The inspections of the waste were insufficient and waste with hazardous properties was therefore not removed.

At 0830 hours, the crew members of the vessel commenced the securing operation on deck.  At around 0955 hours, an able bodied seaman (AB1) and a deck Fitter (Fitter) noticed the hoisting wire of the No. 1 crane jammed with the hook block (the block).  Without informing the chief officer (the C/O), the AB1 and the Fitter attempted to check the block and its hoisting wire on the top level of the uneven logs.  Suddenly, the block was shifted and rotated during their inspection.  The sudden movement of the block caused the taut wiggle wire to move abruptly, resulting in the AB1 and the Fitter being struck into the sea from the top of the log cargoes.  The Fitter was conscious but the AB1 was observed with his face submerged after falling into the water.  A Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) was performed on the AB1 immediately upon rescued. Unfortunately, at 1258 hours on the same day, the AB1 was declared dead on board by the shore Health Extension Officer (HEO). The investigation had identified the following contributory factors of this accident:  the toolbox talk was not conducted on board before the securing operation in accordance with the requirements of the Shipboard Management System (SMS);  the crew members failed to follow the requirements of the Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seafarers  (the Code) to rig suitable safety nets or temporary fencing while carrying out the securing operation on top of the deck cargoes;  the AB1 and the Fitter had inadequate safety awareness and underestimated the risk of unexpected freeing of the jammed wire during the inspection of the wiggle wire lashing system;  the crew members failed to follow the requirements of the shipboard Cargo Securing Manual (CSM) to carry out the securing operation;  the shipboard training to crew members in the securing operation of the cargoes was ineffective.  
The investigation also revealed that the risk of the securing operation was not covered in the shipboard Risk Assessment Manual (RAM) of the SMS, and the CSM did not update to meet the requirements of the Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes, 2011 (2011 TDC Code) .

One of the practise sessions was an exercise in rescuing survivors from the water using a lifeboat. The lifeboat was a totally enclosed model with side hatches that is intended for a maximum of 26 persons. The lifeboat was also approved for use as a rescue boat. During the exercise, the lifeboat started listing heavily and became flooded with water through a side hatch. Three people ended up in the water and the lifeboat had to be abandoned. None of those on board suffered any injuries. During the occurrence, the lifeboat was lightly loaded, with few persons on board in comparison to the capacity of the lifeboat. Some of the basic equipment such as water, provisions etc. was not on board either. All the hatches were open to allow the participants to practise bringing casualties on board out of the water. The forces that arose when the participants in the exercise moved around in the boat resulted in a change in the centre of gravity, which led to the lifeboat starting to list heavily and to the edge of the side hatch ending up under the waterline. The lifeboat complied with applicable stability requirements. Nevertheless, the investigation shows that, under certain conditions, this type of lifeboat has a small stability margin. This means that small forces are able to generate large angles of heel and that, under certain conditions, lifeboats of this type are able to take on water and heel over if the boat is being manoeuvred with open side hatches. This is especially the case when the lifeboat is lightly loaded with few persons on board. It is reasonable to assume that other lifeboats of similar types and sizes may have similar stability properties. The accident was caused by the lifeboats stability properties, which meant that small changes in centre of gravity gave rise to large angles of heel. When those on board moved around in the lifeboat in order to allow the helmsman to be changed, the centre of gravity moved upwards. This led to the boat heeling heavily, taking on water through an open side hatch and heeled over. At system level, the accident was caused by insufficient stability requirements for small, enclosed lifeboats with side openings near the gunwale.","Other Activities Ships","","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2023-02-08",""

When anchoring, one of the anchor chains had kinked, and the chief mate and the two deck hands, one AB and one OS, had subsequently opened the chain box. The work was prepared through issuing of an enclosed space entry permit. During the work it was noted that a working light was out of order, and one of the two deck hands, the AB, was asked to fetch a replacement. At the same time, the OS was on the forecastle for further preparations. A sound made him go down from the forecastle, and he then saw the hatch down to the forward shaft of the cargo hold being opened. The shaft, that from a ventilation perspective was part of the cargo hold and consequently an enclosed space, was not to be entered until atmosphere was deemed to be safe. All the way down at the bottom, he saw the AB lying and realized that BA set was necessary to assist him. Hence, the OS immediately called for emergency assistance. After a great deal of problems, the AB was brought up on deck through the narrow space while the master called for assistance. Though CPR commenced directly as the AB was on deck, he was still unconscious when the rescue helicopter arrived, and the AB was announced dead upon arrival at the hospital. The post mortem suggests that the deceased was subjected to severe hypoxia and that the cause of death is suffocation as a result of spending time in the shaft. An audit of the vessels SMS that was conducted after the occurrence revealed several nonconformities. Furthermore, one observation was made by the auditor showing that communication between the vessel and the shipping company, Hermann Lohmann Schiffahrtsverwaltung GmbH, regarding safety management issues may be regarded as too limited. This leads to the conclusion that the SMS was not effectively implemented, which in turn constitutes an underlying factor to the occurrence. The direct cause of the accident was that the AB went down into an enclosed space where there was a lack of oxygen. The hatch to the shaft was not cordoned off, which means that a safety barrier was broken. It has however not been possible to establish why the victim went down into the cargo hold shaft.

Mohd Jaaffar, who was tasked with servicing fire-fighting equipment, identified 12 dry chemical fire
extinguishers which were no longer serviceable due to excessive corrosion. He consequently
condemned the 12 units of the fire extinguishers. The extinguishers in question were originally placed
at helipad by the fixed fire-fighting monitor. After the initial inspection, the 12 units were removed
from service and relocated to the lifeboat 3 muster station. It was then decided to transfer the
condemned units to the condenser room on the port main deck to keep the pressurized units away from
the high traffic areas. The OIM instructed the Night Barge Supervisor to discharge the content of the
condemned units overboard. The purpose was to avoid any accidental discharge of the condemned
extinguishers due to excessive corrosion of the units.

That same morning, the ro-ro vessel FINLANDIA SEAWAYS arrived at the harbour. Due to a forthcoming practical exam for fairway-specific pilot exemption certificate, the master manoeuvred the vessel in the fairway towards the dock while the pilot, who had come on board outside of the harbour, took on a supervisory role. Just after the vessel had passed the dredging unit, a turn to port was initiated with the intention of turning the vessel around and then reversing it into its berth further into the harbour. Once the turn had begun, the vessel moved astern and thus got closer to the dredging unit. When the people on the vessels bridge acknowledged the vessels direction of travel and the decreasing distance to the dredging unit, the engine controls were set to full ahead. Just after this, the stern of the vessel collided with the tug ATLE. The collision resulted in extensive damage to ATLE. The occurrence did not result in any personal injuries. The occurrence was caused by inadequate situational awareness among the crew and pilot on board FINLANDIA SEAWAYS. The inadequate situational awareness may be explained to some extent by the manoeuvring controls on the bridge being switched over from the centre console to the bridge wing after the turn to rotate the vessel around had been initiated. In conjunction with the switch-over, the sense of the vessels speed and direction of travel was momentarily lost. The control function, in the form of a lookout in the stern, was activated too late to prevent the collision. Another probable contributing factor is that the master was distracted due to the forthcoming exam and thus lost focus on the vessels movements when she was being turned around.","Ro-Ro Cargo Ship","","11530","","8702","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2022-08-15",""

They worked from the ship VESTA, an eleven-metre-long workboat. At half past nine in the morning, the crew stopped the work to take a lunch break. They intended to moor at the bridge that runs between Torshamnen and Risholmen, a low bridge that has a vertical clearance of about three meters. The boat was slowly manoeuvring towards the bridge and one of the crew members went forward to be ready to moor. The driver engaged reverse gear, but there was no effect, after which he pulled the control further back. VESTA then continued forward in a rapid starboard turn and hit the bridge. The person in the bow did not manage to dodge or get himself to a safe position and got caught between the wheelhouse and the bridge suffering severe fatal injuries. The rescue effort was hampered by the difference in height between the bridge and the boat, but another of the company's boats arrived quickly to the scene of the accident and towed VESTA to the southern end of the bridge where an ambulance could take care of the injured for further transport. The accident was caused by a fatigue induced crack leading to a failure in the stainless-steel wire in the control cable, used for switching between ahead and astern. Ahead remained in place, despite the control lever being pulled towards astern. The control lever then worked in an opposite way in the reverse position and full astern then became full ahead. The short distance to the bridge meant that the driver of the boat did not have time to take any corrective measures before the collision. A prerequisite for the fracture of the metal wire was that the control cable was bent where the flexible casing meets the rigid metal end sleeve, which eventually led to a fatigue fracture due to repeated bending and straightening movements at each shifting.

miles off the Southeast of Vietnam the Master tried to contact the Chief Engineer, in the engine
room and upon not finding him there asked the 3rd Officer to try to contact and look for him in
various public places but no one reportedly saw him that day. C/E’s locked cabin was opened
by the master key but he was not to be seen there. It was then realized that the Chief Engineer
was missing from his cabin and engine room.
A few minutes later emergency alarm was raised and a public address announcement was made
to search for C/E on board. Ship compliment was put on thorough search on board. Following
this the vessel was turned around on a reciprocal course to head back to the last known position
when C/E was last sighted around midnight of 09th February 2021. In the ship’s crew search on
board, Chief Engineer was not found, soon after the Master informed the Owners about the missing
Chief Engineer.
After informing the ship owners and managers, the vessel began broadcasting an urgent message on
VHF and MF/HF. MRCC Haiphong responded to an urgent call, later around the noon time
Australian Maritime Patrol Aircraft also responded on 10th February. The Australian Maritime
Patrol Aircraft took details of the last sighting of the Chief Engineer and reported that they
would head to the advised location of 23:45hr, 9th February. In the meantime, MRCC Vung
Tau also confirmed the vessel’s report of the Man Overboard.
All this while the vessel was on a reciprocal course with extra lookouts extra posted searching
at sea the missing Chief Engineer. By 14:00hr on 10th Feb, vessel Managers advised to the ship
to resume the voyage to Bangladesh as the SAR would be conducted by the concerned MRCC
and the Australian Aircraft.
By 16:27 hrs, MRCC Singapore had also acknowledged the vessel’s MF/HF call about the Man
Overboard. 10 min later, US Govt. vessel “VSL 14” also exchanged details of the vessel and
joined the SAR.
By 17:35 hrs on 10th Feb, the Australian Maritime Patrol Craft and the US Govt. “VSL 14”
reported no success in finding missing C/E, hence called off the search.

The vessel in transit to Bangladesh stopped and anchored in Singapore on 12th February 2021
for the purpose of bunkering. The Coastguard officials boarded the vessel for an investigation.
Singapore Coastguard interviewed the master & crew, inspected the cabin of the Chief Engineer, and
collected the required information and documents.
The vessel departed from Singapore on the evening of 12th February. She arrived at Chittagong
Roads on 17th February and dropped anchor awaiting cargo discharging orders.
The P&I surveyor boarded the vessel on the 18th of February and carried out an investigation on
behalf of the insurers.
Various attempts were made to establish contact with the wife, the next of kin of the missing Chief
Engineer, but all in vain.
Flag state investigation analysis was carried out on the basis of evidence collected from the ship,

During the voyage, the vessel experienced inclement weather and the voyage plan was progressively amended, based on the advice received from a weather routeing service. On 29 January 2021, the eductor was started to pump out the water from the forecastle store, which was found flooded by the crew members. On the next day, five deck crew members, including the deck cadet, were instructed to extract the remaining water from the forecastle store and chain lockers, using portable pumps, dry up the store, cover the spurling pipes on the forecastle deck, and arrange and secure all equipment within the store. The vessels course was altered to minimize the rolling and pitching and thus, facilitate the safety of the deck ratings. Whilst the crew members were covering the spurling pipes, a large wave washed over the forecastle deck. All the crew members were swept across the forecastle. Injured crew members were helped back to the accommodation. In the meantime, the vessel diverted towards the port of Halifax, Canada. Eventually, one of the injured crew members succumbed to his injuries whilst the vessel was still en route. The safety investigation concluded that there was a sense of urgency to pump out the accumulated water and take immediate action to prevent further flooding. Moreover, the weather conditions limited the extent of the course alteration.","Bulk Dry (general, ore) Carrier","Loss of life,Serious injuries,Ship remains fit to proceed","25303","RINA Services S.p.A (RINA)","39202","Dry bulk","21","0","0","1","0","0","4","0","0","2022-01-28",""
