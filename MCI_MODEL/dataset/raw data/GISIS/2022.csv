Despite the Pilot applying starboard helm to counter the anticipated currents and counter currents, the vessel rapidly sheered to port, leaving the channel, before grounding heavily by the bow on a mud and rock bottom at approximately 19.21 hrs. After sounding all compartments and determining no apparent water ingress, the vessel was re-floated under its own power on the still rising tide.

The Skipper tried to stop the main engine with the emergency stop button on the wheelhouse console, but this failed. The mooring ropes holding the vessel parted and the vessel went quickly astern and made heavy contact with the southern boat marina pontoon causing extensive damage to the pontoon and to several boats that were secured there at the time. The main engine was eventually stopped by shutting off the fuel and the vessel drifted across the harbour basin. Another trawler, moored on the main jetty, saw the incident, and quickly went to assist and towed the FV Bikain back alongside the jetty. There were no injuries and no pollution, but extensive damage was caused to the southern pontoon and moored boats. As this was a French flagged vessel, the Director of the Bureau denqutes sur les vnements de mer (BEAmer) (French Marine Casualties Investigation Office of the Ministry of the Sea) also decided to investigate jointly with the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB).","Fish Catching Vessel","","285","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2023-09-15",""

The inspection round started with the descent of a stairs down to the main engine. The Chief engineer slipped when he was on top of the stairs and fell backwards. He slid on his back all the way down the stairs. His head hit the railing. The chief engineer was empty handed and was wearing a helmet with the chin strap fastened. He was wearing hearing protection and new safety shoes. Reportedly, he had his hands on the railing on the moment he fell down. The rubber outsole of his safety shoe was in perfect condition, but grease was found between the profile of his left shoe. The combination of the paint used on the platform of the stairway and the grease on the soleplate of the shoe, most probably made the chief engineer slip and fall. Most probably, the helmet prevented the chief engineer of a more serious head trauma. There was no indication of any fatigue.

A tugboat also participated in the work. At around two oclock in the morning the master on NORDLAND could see smoke coming from the engine room. He drove the boat alongside of the tug boat and called for help. At first it seemed that the smoke subsided. To prevent that a possible fire would spread to the tug boat, they untied NORDLAND and let it drift. Two hours later NORDLAND caught fire. Since there were no people onboard and the ship did not block the fairway, it was decided to let it burn. At five oclock in the morning NORDLAND sank. The day after, the Swedish Coast Guard were able to salvage some of the remaining parts of the wreck from about 7 metres depth. The engines, transom, sterndrives and propellers were brought onboard the vessel KBV 051. The forwardmost part of the boats hull was left on the bottom of the lake, since it did not pose a threat to the environment. The fuel tanks were never recovered, possibly incinerated in the fire. After the salvage operation, oil could no longer be seen on the surface of the lake. According to information from the master, the progress of the fire was rapid and the fire was strong. This is supported by the very extensive damage where most of the ship was completely incinerated. The remaining parts were heavily destroyed and damaged by the heat, apart from the sterndrives and propellers which remained undamaged. The salvaged parts of the wreck were sold by the owner the day after the fire. Despite initial search efforts, the salvaged parts could not be found. These parts have therefore not been able to be examined other than through an examination of photographs. The assessment is that the wreckage that was recovered does not constitute a sufficient basis for determining the cause of the fire. No further research into the sold wreckage has therefore been done. All in all, the investigation material does not provide a basis for any more detailed conclusions about the cause of the incident and therefore also no basis for any safety-enhancing recommendations.","Other Activities Ships","Ship rendered unfit to proceed","","","","","","0","","0","0","0","0","0","0","2023-03-01",""

The crew managed to bring the technicians out of the tank while they were still alive, but they perished shortly after. Overall, it can be concluded that on NORD MAGIC enclosed space entries were frequent, necessary and did not supersede other work activities on board, e.g. cargo surveyor meetings, discharging cargo, making barges fast, squeezing cargo tanks, keeping anchor watch, etc. The chief officer was pivotal in managing competing demands when several tasks were to be performed simultaneously. In addition, he was the person responsible for managing the work permits authorising enclosed space entries. When he, as the responsible officer, was absent, the functioning of the work permit system failed to meet its intended purpose. The disadvantages of a hierarchy, where only one officer is responsible, were thus manifested. These disadvantages were compounded by a work permit system which was not effective in governing the crewmembers and technicians work practises related to entry into enclosed spaces.","Chemical Tanker","Loss of life","29266","","49999","","23","0","","2","0","0","0","0","0","2023-01-09",""

SB net sank deeper in the sandy sea bottom than PS net and so pulled the vessel to SB. At app.2030, an alarm sounded in the engine room.

He called one of the Ab to take over the rudder and went to the engine room before the AB appeared on the bridge. After 7 minutes, the skipper came back on the bridge, justa little bit later than the AB. The skipper noticed that the vessel did not turn to PS and that the vessel was very clos to the shore. The skipper steered the vessel away from the shore and stopped the engine, but the vessel did not immediately loose speed. Then, the skipper started hauling the nets, but as the power of the winch was related to the ship's engine, the nets only went up slowly.

At 03:50 LT the Chief Officer and duty AB went to the bridge for the handover and at 04:00 hours change of watch. A bulk carrier, later identified as ""ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN"" was seen at the port bow of the MV “ACRA” at a distance of 9.9 nm. AB saw her two masthead lights and green side light and reported to the Chief Officer. At 05:35 LT the Chief Officer as the Duty Officer called MV ""ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN"" several times on the VHF 16 without getting a response. The OOW rechecked the plotted data and the true bearing of MV ""ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN"" was now 025 degrees at a distance of 2.9 nm. Her course was 175 and her speed was about 13.1 knots. The OOW ordered AB to send flash signals with ALDIS LAMP to the opponent vessel and sounded more than five (5) short blasts by ship’s whistle. Seeing that MV ""ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN"" was not taking any effective action to avoid collision. The OOW ordered the AB to switch the steering gear to manual mode. At about 05:42 LT, OOW commanded the wheelsman to turn the rudder ""hard to starboard"" to avoid collision. At that time, the course and speed of MV ""ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN"" as displayed on the radar, was 177 degrees and 13 knots, true bearing was 022 degrees at a distance of 0.42 nm. At 05:44 LT, in GPS position Lat..31012.79N / Long.123014.11E, MV “ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN’s” starboard bow collided with the port quarter of the MV “ACRA”. The “ACRA” stopped main engine, sounded general alarm followed by a public address announcement to all crew to muster at abandon ship stations. 
The Master came at the bridge and took command of the vessel to reduce the impact to the “ACRA” and l and to the “ZHONG LIANG DONG NAN”. The “ACRA” sent distress alerts via CH.16 DSC CH.70, INMARSAT -C Station. Mustered crew at abandon ship station. Prepares lifesaving appliances and assessed damage to the vessel. No signs of pollution. Alerted vessels in the vicinity and advised managers about the incident.

The weather was calm, and the vessel was neither rolling nor pitching. The victim was working for a specialist company named Top Rope, which provides personnel capable of performing work at height. He was medically fit and well rested. At the time of the incident, he was wiping a metal surface at a height of about 8 meters from the main deck. He was using a flammable liquid cleaner (thinner) in an open metal can, which was secured in some way near his side. He was properly secured with a rope and harness, and was wearing proper personal protective equipment. The victim was assisted by a co-worker, an employee of the same specialist company. At a higher level, about 3m in the horizontal and 4m in vertical distance, a team of welders were performing hot work. The Top Rope workers saw sparks coming towards them, and falling down on the main deck, from the area where hot work was carried out. However, it was decided that the sparks were falling at a safe distance from their work place, so they continued their task. Nevertheless, sparks from the welders fell into the can with thinner, which caught fire. The Top Rope worker tried to get rid of the can by pushing it, but by doing so the thinner splashed on his body. He was suddenly completely ablaze, the rope and safety harness burnt and he fell down to the main deck. Intervention by the ships doctor and emergency team was unsuccessful, as the casualty succumbed to his injuries. The Master requested a service boat from the ships agent and the casualty was transferred by the service boat ashore, where his death was confirmed.","Other Activities Ships","Loss of life","21049","","11000","","150","0","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2023-05-03",""

The deck crew were in the process of readying the cargo hatches by removing wedges and other sea fastening equipment on the hatch deck. A member of the deck crew fell overboard as he was moving from the hatch deck down to the main deck. None of the other crew members witnessed the incident, and it consequently took about 20 minutes before they realised that the deck cadet was missing. Shortly after it was discovered that the cadet was missing, the rescue services were notified, and the captain turned the vessel. Due to uncertainty about when the cadet fell overboard, the search area was initially set too far north. After approximately two hours, the correct time was determined using the ships CCTV footage, and vessels were deployed to search further south where the cadet had fallen overboard. A coverall and protective shoes were found, but not the missing person. Preparing for unloading was considered a routine operation by the crew and shipping company, and they had therefore not considered or identified any risk reduction measures relating to this type of operation. No special safety measures had been introduced to prevent crew members falling overboard from the hatch deck, nor had sufficient measures been taken to reduce the consequences of falling into the sea. The risk associated with routine tasks becomes normalised in the individual over time, resulting in the risk gradually being ignored or not perceived. Shipping companies and other stakeholders must therefore consider the need for risk assessments and safe job analyses in all areas of operation that may entail risk, including those defined as routine operations. The vessel had no physical safety barriers against falling overboard from the hatch deck, only railings on the main deck along the cargo hatches. The NSIA considers that the way the deck was designed, with a short distance from the outer edge of the hatch deck to the railings at a considerably lower level, was inexpedient in relation to the work to be performed, and that it entailed a risk of falling overboard. However, this is not an unusual design for this type of ship. As the crew did not witness the missing person fall overboard, it was impossible for them to estimate the exact time of the incident. The NSIA believes it is essential for the crew of a vessel to clearly communicate any uncertainty about when a person fell overboard to the rescue services, so that the search area can be defined accordingly. The shipping company has implemented several measures to help to improve safety since the accident.","General Cargo Ship","Loss of life","2744","","4775","","","","","1","0","0","0","0","0","2022-10-13",""
