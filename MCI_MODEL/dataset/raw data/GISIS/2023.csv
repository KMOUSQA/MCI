It was subsequently discovered that intermittent arcing of the electrical circuitry was occurring below the bridge deck in the “Dog House” compartment.  Shortly thereafter, smoke was seen emanating from behind the bulkhead.  In an attempt to find the source of the smoke, the crew conducted fire checks in the galley and below on the main deck in the guest accommodation.  This was to no avail and the search was called off due to the build-up of toxic fumes, and smoke that reduced visibility significantly.   
At approximately 23:20 the decision was taken by the Captain to abandon the MIRACLE.  At about 23:53LT the United States (US) Coast Guard Station in Puerto Rico deployed the US Coast Guard Cutter JOSEPH NAPIER in response to the distress call.  The CG Cutter rendezvous with the stricken crew whom by then were underway in the tender vessel, whereupon they were escorted to the port of ANASCO Puerto Rico and processed by the local authorities.
