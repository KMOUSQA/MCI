As the daughter craft went in closer to the coast, the wave action on the beach was higher than anticipated which resulted in the daughter craft heeling over. One crew member fell overboard when the vessel heeled and the second crew member voluntarily jumped into the water, which was waist deep, to stabilize the craft and to recover the other crew member.  The two crew were unharmed and were able to reboard the craft and return to the main search and rescue vessel. They were checked over and were unharmed. The heeling event was reported to have happened due to the fact that the lights on the main vessel were not strong enough to illuminate closer into the shore and therefore the crew underestimated the size of the waves close to the shore.

The crewmember was stirring a pot in the galley when they accidentally operated the foot operated valve for a steam vent outlet whilst their leg was positioned in front of the steam vent pipe. The crewmember sustained a scald injury to their ankle from the steam and were signed off work for 5 days in order to heal. The incident reportedly occurred due to a lack of situational awareness about where the crewmember was standing in relation to the steam vent operating lever and the outlet for the steam vent.

There was a light rain shower at the time and the temperature above 0’C, so no ice. As the vessel enters Stromness harbour, proceeding to the berth, the IP got out from the wheelhouse to get all the ropes ready for docking the boat overnight. After completing that activity, the IP went back to the wheelhouse to get their personal belongings. They’ve changed from work wellington boots to their own steel toe work footwear, (they’ve used that brand of footwear for past 4 years, and never had issues). However when they step out from wheelhouse again, to put side ropes to the ladder at the berth, the mooring rope they got ready earlier, appears to have moved a little into the area just outside wheelhouse door. When they step out they’ve put their right foot directly onto the mooring rope and their foot rolled over from the rope causing what they thought was an ankle strain.

They fell backwards down the escalator sustaining injuries to their back. The crew member sustained bruising to their back and had 4 days and 22 hours off work to recover but they were not discharged from the vessel.

Following the accident the importance of wearing PPE correctly was re-iterated to galley and restaurant teams and a visual indication was to be added to the bulkhead near the top of the escalator so that crew carrying trays could see where the escalator ends.
