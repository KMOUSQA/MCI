Gangway was secured to ships side via one portable magnet and the pilot ladder was secured to ship side via recessed pad eye in shell plating. First pilot disembarked vessel without incident, second pilot was on the bottom platform of the gangway just about to step across onto the pilot ladder, when the magnet failed causing the gangway to swing away from the ship side by several metres (due to circa 2.5m swell) and violently come into contact with the ships side. This happened several times as the pilot made his way up the gangway to the deck. Ships crew re -rigged the combination ladder, this time the gangway was made fast to the recessed pad eye and two magnets fixed to either side of the pilot ladder. Pilot proceeded down the gangway and onto the pilot ladder, approx 5 steps down the ladder the fwd most magnet was noted to slide significantly(but not come away from the ship side).

The crew member raised the alarm and the crew mustered. Whilst a two person fire fighting team wearing breathing apparatus was preparing, another crew member took immediate action using a CO2 fire extinguisher. They noticed the flames were on the lagging of the exhaust and this initial action reduced the fire's intensity. The crew member then used a foam extinguisher to fully extinguish the fire. The crew carried out emergency shut down including fuel and lubricating oil shut down and ventilation shut down. The fire fighting team with breathing apparatus arrived and checked that the fire was extinguished and there was no risk of re-ignition. The fire reportedly occurred due to overheating of the lagging material around the exhaust, probably caused by an engine load test that had been carried out earlier in the day combined with oil and residues in the lagging.

As discussed please ensure the following additional measures are taken in future when rigging the pilot transfer arrangement to make the process even safer. - Securing of the pilot ladder - the pilot ladder winch real should not be relied upon to support the pilot ladder when the pilot ladder is in use. The pilot ladder should be secured to a strong point, independent of the pilot ladder winch reel and at deck level. - Mechanical securing of the pilot ladder winch reel - All pilot ladder winch reels should have means of preventing the winch reel from being accidentally operated as a result of mechanical failure or human error. A mechanical device or locking pin should be utilized to lock winch reels in position once the pilot ladder is lowered into position. - please check that the lifebuoy(s) in the vicinity of the transfer arrangement have a self activating light attached.

Following a satisfactory completion of the manoeuvre, the pilot thrust the bow to starboard and came ahead on both engines. It became apparent that the bow thruster was having little effect and that the stern was closing on the berth. To avoid contact with the stern on the berth, the pilot split the engines to slow the closing speed. The bow moved rapidly to port and inside the line of the jetty. Once the stern was clear, the port engine was put astern followed by the starboard. Due to the aspect of the vessel, the ebb tide pushed the vessel sideways to the fender. This resulted in contact with the steel bracket at the rear of the fender causing a hull penetration.

The vessel was approaching its destination, intending to berth. Due to the weather conditions in the port, the vessel requested a tug standby. As the vessel made its final approach, the bow thruster alarm sounded and the engine control room informed the bridge that the number 3 bow thruster had tripped. The tug that was standing by was requested to push at 40% power and then requested to push at 100% power 30 seconds later. At the same time this request was made, number 2 bow thruster tripped. The pitch of the bow thrusters was set to zero and the crew attempted to restart the tripped thrusters. The ECR informed the bridge that they would need to wait 30 seconds before the bow thrusters could be restarted. By the time the bow thrusters had been restarted, there was little that could be done to negate an impact and the 'brace' alarm was sounded across the vessel to warn the crew and passengers. Whilst trying to lift the vessel, the number 3 bow thruster tripped again and the tug was requested to continue pushing at 100% power. The tug only had 1 engine as it had fouled a propeller. The Ro-Ro landed again and whilst alongside, the decision was taken to restart all thrusters and call in another tug to assist which, made fast to the port quarter.

The operation of the plunger required the operator to draw the handle upwards to fill the pump with water, then push the handle downwards causing the water to expel under pressure clearing the blockage. During the process of operating the plunger, the piston rod and handle of the plunger became detached from the piston resulting in the piston remaining at the bottom or the plunger. The IP tried to clear the piston from the plunger using a screwdriver. The IP held the plunger in their non-dominant left hand and tried to insert the screwdriver into the casing of the plunger trough the bottom opening. As the IP applied force to the screwdriver, the screwdriver slipped off the plunger and stabbed the IP’s left hand which resulted in a puncture injury to the soft tissue area of the hand. First aid was applied, including a full wash of the injury using water and antiseptic wipes, and a plaster applied.

The Master said the vessel was listed slightly to port and when the vessel landed it made contact as the fenders compressed. The vessel had the tugs pushing up alongside 50%.

The vessel had 3 spring and 2 stern lines out aft and 3 spring, 2 breast and 1 head line out forward. The master and pilot made the decision to sail from the berth and singled up for departure.

She returned to the dock and lined up for the outer passage. On entering the river the bow grounded on the edge of the shoal. Due to the vessel's length, the stern of the vessel did not clear the southern side of the dock entrance. This resulted in the vessel’s stern coming to rest on the tyre fendering on the south side of the dock entrance. Using the bow thruster, main engine, and port helm, an attempt was made to clear the shoal and lift the stern off the fendering. Though the stern lifted slightly the bow failed to move. It was evident that the vessel was wedged athwart the river. On the grounds of safety, the Master informed that they had requested the immediate assistance of a tug to aid their situation. On the prompt arrival of the tug, they directed her to push on the starboard shoulder to clear the shoal and then instructed her to push on the port quarter to safely aid the swing of the vessel. They finally asked her to push on the port bow to help maintain the vessel's position in the deeper water well away from the shoal. When heading out the vessel proceeded safely on outbound passage. The tug was released, and the vessel proceeded to sea without further incident. The Master & crew established that the vessel had sustained no damage and that all systems were in working order.

The ship didn’t pick up speed for a number of minutes and the pilot assumed there was a problem with the pitch/engine. The pilot managed to steer with the bow thruster and got the anchor ready whilst the captain was conversing with chief engineer. The pilot decided to swing to proceed outwards as he didn’t want to carry on without having time to assess everything. Afterwards, the engine/rudder was checked  and chief engineer reported of no issues.

The crewmember noticed flames coming from the turbocharger of the generator that was running. The crewmember activated the emergency stop and left the space, subsequently activating the manual call point for a fire. The crew on the bridge believed that the alarm and sound of the generator shutting down was a blackout but was informed by the crewmember from the engine room shortly after that it was a fire. The emergency procedures for a fire were implemented and the fire was later reported extinguished with no damage reported. The high temperature alarm for the generator had been changed meaning that the alarm didn't activate when it should have done. Reportedly, if the high temperature limit had not been increased, the high temperature alarm would have activated 16 minutes earlier and there would not have been a fire. The fire was believed to have been caused by the gasket for the oil feed pipe being in poor condition allowing oil vapor to contact the hot turbo charger. Additionally, the bolts holding the turbo charger were so loose that they were not even hand-tight. There were no injuries, damage or pollution arising from the incident.

The vessel proceeded on passage but then aborted to enable the vessel to go to anchorage for an engine assessment. The assessment concluded that there were no issues with the engine and the propulsion equipment was all in working order. The reason behind the power failure was due to a mistake on the part of the chief engineer who attempted to change over from one lubricating oil filter to the other, but made the change too quickly which did not allow the air to clear the chamber of the filter which subsequently resulted in a drop in lubricating oil pressure. The system then initiated a shut down due to the inbuilt safety system responding to the sudden pressure drop.

The vessel's crew were carrying out a manual load control test on one of the 4 diesel generators (DG) on board. The generator then had a high temperature alarm on the main baring (later found to be a sensor fault). The next DG in line attempted to start however it could not because the breaker failed to close. This meant that there was only one generator left running which then tripped due to the inbuilt system to prevent reverse power and over speed. Due to the fact that one of the generators was in manual control, this reportedly 'confused' the PMS meaning it could not complete the power restoration sequence as it would do during routine running.

The bridge team observed that the revolutions suddenly dropped and the controls for the main engine switched to 'engine control'. Approximately two seconds later, the main engine control was ready for 'service on bridge' and the master took back control of the main engine immediately and increased to full ahead. The propulsion failure effected the vessel for no longer than 5 seconds. The reason behind the failure was that the chief engineer decided to take control of the main engine down to the engine room without informing the bridge. This was because of the cooling water and lube oil temperatures increasing towards alarm level and the chief engineer intended to set a lock on the main engine RPM to prevent overheating and main engine shut down. The Chief engineer was new on board, it was their first day after joining and the incident was attributed to their lack of familiarity with the system and spontaneous reaction to try to prevent ME overheating. The chief engineer was instructed not to take control from the bridge without informing the bridge team and a set of new thermostats were ordered for the main engine to ensure that the temperature readings were accurate. There were no injuries pollution or damage as a result of the incident and the vessel proceeded on passage without further issue.

The flow of fuel was not noticed until the fuel oil now floating on the surface was witness by an adjacent vessel who alerted the crew aboard. The master investigated and immediately raised the alarm to shut down all systems and begin a SOPEP response. The relevant parties where informed and a spill containment implemented shortly after. The port authority attended to the vessel and begun to deploy a series of oil control booms. The booms were used to stop the spread of the fuel and contain the spill to between the aft of the vessel and the quay wall. The port officer assessed the spill and raised its priority to a tier two response. An oil extraction vehicle was arranged, and additional small craft attended to the scene to assist in manoeuvring the booms and further containing the spill. Once the extraction vehicle had arrived to scene, the operator deployed the extraction hose, with the assistance of the small craft begun to remove the corralled fuel from the boomed area.

Reportedly the vessel was being navigated by the captain with the pilot's advice when a course alteration to port was necessary but too much rudder was applied and the vessel began to turn too quickly coming to rest on the sand at the edge of the deep water channel. The crew of the sail training vessel initially attempted to push the vessel off the sand with ship's own tender but it was unsuccessful so a tug was ordered from the port. The tug made fast on the stern of the sail training vessel and pulled the vessel free of the sandbank. The vessel then proceeded to sea without further incident.

The tug on aft stations was asked to change position to the accommodation block as the aft spring lines and aft breast-lines were tangled on the deck and required being slackened before being let go. As the tug moved to the accommodation, the stern of the LPG tanker came away from the berth at speed as the lines slackened, causing the aft breast-line to part. There were no injuries or damages besides the parted line.  Notes:  The main deck of the vessel was located below the jetty level, whereby the mooring lines were heading diagonally upwards instead of directing straight to the pier. One mooring line was directly dropped into the water by the lines man after lifting off the aft spring from the bollard. After the tug received the order from the pilot to shift back on the vessels stern, the Captain of the tug was following the order immediately and rapidly shifted back to the initial position, in order to be available again as fast as possible. While doing this, the Master of the tug did not consider the size ratio between the tug and the ship. The used tug was 32 m long, with a bollard pull of approx. 67 tones. While the tanker was only 87,5 m long. The used tug was oversized compared to the size of the ship. And a small tug movement produced a negative effect onto the ship.

Once the stern of the vessel was clear of the dock, the Master was advised to engage his engine full astern and bow thrust full power to starboard. The Master carried out these manoeuvres very slowly and the vessel speed reduced accordingly. At this time the vessel's bow was still setting south with the tide at which time the pilot enquired into the anchor status – the Master replied that only one shackle on deck was deployed. The pilot advised the Master to lay more anchor into the water which was implemented. The delays in dropping anchor and full astern engine engagement severely hampered the vessels ability to swing to starboard into the tide.

This arrangement is approved by SOLAS and class for the specific vessel, however the pilot raised issue with it because the ladder should have been flat against the hull for the full length. The ladder was rigged in the position further back. However, this position is not always suitable for the rigging of the pilot ladder in poor weather as it requires crew to use the crane to rig it and stand in an unprotected area. There were no injuries, damages or pollution. The pilot recommended to the vessel to permanently rig the ladder in the further aft pilot ladder location.

Whilst letting go lines, the current caught the vessel and caused it to swing snatching the boarding area towards the quay. This meant that the bulwarks and safety rails making up the specialized boarding gate came into contact with the quay resulting in the gate detaching and falling into the water. This gate is part of the vessel's equipment for carrying out crew transfers safely therefore whilst it is broken the vessel is out of service. The vessel required repairs that needed approval by classification society. The incident was reported to be due to the master misjudging the strength and effect of the current and the mooring arrangement chosen only had a short spring line to prevent the vessel from moving along the quay.

It was around 4pm, there was limited natural light (as at 4pm it is dark), but there was some artificial light from the vessel lights and also street lights at the pier, illuminating the neighbourhood.  There was a light rain shower at the time and the temperature above 0’C, so no ice. As the vessel enters Stromness harbour, proceeding to the berth, the IP got out from the wheelhouse to get all the ropes ready for docking the boat overnight. After completing that activity, the IP went back to the wheelhouse to get their personal belongings. They’ve changed from work wellington boots to their own steel toe work footwear, (they’ve used that brand of footwear for past 4 years, and never had issues). However when they step out from wheelhouse again, to put side ropes to the ladder at the berth, the mooring rope they got ready earlier, appears to have moved a little into the area just outside wheelhouse door. When they step out they’ve put their right foot directly onto the mooring rope and their foot rolled over from the rope causing what they thought was an ankle strain. The foot was swollen and following a week off work they returned to their Dr, who in turn recommended an X-ray, where it was discovered that there was a fracture to the base ® metatarsal. The task being undertaken was a daily routine, and everyone knew their role in this activity, and how it was to be conducted.
